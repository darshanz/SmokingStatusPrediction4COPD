## üìÅ Repository Overview

This repository contains supplementary materials for our study focused on predicting smoking status among patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) using deep learning techniques applied to national survey data.

## üß† Proposed Model Architecture

We developed a Residual Neural Network (ResNN) architecture‚Äîa feedforward neural network with residual connections‚Äîto predict smoking status. The model includes an input layer with 21 features, three hidden layers with 512 ReLU-activated nodes each, and an output layer with Softmax activation. A residual connection from the input to the first hidden layer improves information flow and mitigates vanishing gradients. The model was trained using the AdamW optimizer (learning rate = 0.0001) and focal loss to address class imbalance.

## üìä Experiment Results

The proposed model achieved superior performance (AUROC 0.73, sensitivity 70.1%, specificity 75.2%, F1-score 0.67) in predicting smoking status in COPD patients, with SHAP analysis highlighting sex, age, and perceived health status as key predictors. [More ...](https://doi.org/10.1177/2055207625.)
